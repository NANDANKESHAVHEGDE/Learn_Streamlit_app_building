a.This is light streamlit app which predicts the admit of an applicant to the university program based on key input parameters
b. A base iteration of XG boost is implemented here for the prediction of admit
c. Run the command - streamlit run {filename}.py to get the app working in the localhost
d. requirements.txt file to be installed in the virtual env and then the app can be run from the virtual env [suggested]

This work should serve as a motivation to deploy the quick model in streamlit with a ETA of 3-4 hrs and is built parallely while I am in the second day of my learning.
